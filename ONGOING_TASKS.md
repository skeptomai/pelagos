## Completed: remora exec PID namespace join (2026-02-28)

### Context

`remora exec` did not join the container's PID namespace. When a PID namespace is
active, `state.pid` is the intermediate process P whose `/proc/P/ns/pid` is the host
PID namespace. The fix uses `/proc/P/ns/pid_for_children` as a fallback in
`discover_namespaces`, and implements a double-fork in `container.rs` step 1.65 to
actually enter the target namespace (since `setns(CLONE_NEWPID)` alone only updates
`pid_for_children` — the calling process is not moved; only a subsequent fork enters
the new namespace, followed by exec).

GitHub issue: #1 (closed by this work).

### Files changed

- `src/cli/exec.rs`: `discover_namespaces` — `pid_for_children` fallback
- `src/container.rs`: step 1.65 Case B — PID namespace join double-fork (both
  `spawn()` and `spawn_interactive()` pre-exec hooks)
- `tests/integration_tests.rs`:
  - `build_exec_command` helper updated with `pid_for_children` fallback
  - new test `exec::test_exec_joins_pid_namespace`
- `docs/WATCHER_PROCESS_MODEL.md`: updated caveat section, marked limitation fixed
- `docs/INTEGRATION_TESTS.md`: added `test_exec_joins_pid_namespace` entry
