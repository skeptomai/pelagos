# Remora Watcher Process Model

This document describes the process tree, thread inventory, namespace isolation, and
known limitations of Remora's detached container runtime model.

---

## Overview

When you run `remora run -d <image>`, the CLI does **not** stay resident as a daemon.
Instead it forks a lightweight _watcher process_ that owns the container's lifetime, then
exits immediately (printing the container name). The user's shell is free; the watcher
runs invisibly in the background.

---

## Process Tree

### Without PID Namespace

```
remora run -d (parent)
  └─ fork ──► watcher   [setsid → new session leader]
                 └─ cmd.spawn ──► container process   [PID 1 on host?  No — just some PID]
```

When the parent calls `fork()`, the resulting watcher child calls `setsid()` so it
becomes the leader of a new session, detached from the terminal. When the parent exits,
the watcher is re-parented to init (PID 1 on the host). The watcher then `spawn()`s the
container process.

### With PID Namespace (Enabled — see § "Double-fork")

```
remora run -d (parent)
  └─ fork ──► watcher   [setsid]
                 └─ cmd.spawn ──► intermediate P   [host PID namespace; waits for C]
                                       └─ fork ──► C (PID 1 in container)   [new PID namespace]
```

The library's `pre_exec` hook handles the double-fork transparently. The watcher sees
only one child (the intermediate P) and calls `child.wait()` on it. P calls `waitpid(C)`
and exits with C's exit status. `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` ensures C receives `SIGKILL` if P is
killed unexpectedly.

## Who Is PID 1?

| Mode | PID 1 in container |
|------|--------------------|
| No PID namespace | **Nobody** — the container process has a host PID like 12345; kernel zombie-reaping semantics do not apply |
| PID namespace enabled | **The container's entry point** (e.g. `sleep 60`) — it is literally PID 1 inside the namespace and must reap children |

Without a PID namespace the container process is just a host process in a chroot+mount
jail. Zombie reaping falls to the host's init. This is fine for simple processes but
problematic for any process that spawns children (shells, language runtimes, daemons).

With a PID namespace the entry point becomes PID 1. If the process does not reap
zombies (`waitpid`), zombie accumulation can occur. In practice, using a small init
shim (like `tini`) as the entry point is recommended for multi-child containers.

---

## Namespace Isolation

### Rootfs-based runs (`remora run --rootfs …`)

```
Namespace::UTS | Namespace::MOUNT | Namespace::PID
```

UTS, mount, and PID namespace are always enabled.

### OCI image-based runs (`remora run <image>`)

**Before the fix in this commit:** only `MOUNT` (added by `with_image_layers`) and
`NET` (added by `with_network`) were active — no UTS, **no PID**.

**After the fix:** `Namespace::UTS | Namespace::PID` are added explicitly in
`build_image_run`, matching the rootfs path. Image-based containers now get full PID
and UTS isolation.

---

## Thread Inventory Per Container

### Watcher process — static threads

These threads are always present for every running container:

| Thread | Purpose | Lifetime |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Main thread** | `child.wait()` — blocks until container exits; then writes final `state.json`, cleans up DNS | Container lifetime |
| **stdout relay** | Reads container stdout pipe → appends to `stdout.log` | Until container stdout pipe closes |
| **stderr relay** | Reads container stderr pipe → appends to `stderr.log` | Until container stderr pipe closes |

### Watcher process — optional: health monitor

If the image declares a `HEALTHCHECK`, one additional long-lived thread is added:

| Thread | Purpose | Lifetime |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Health monitor** | Polls container health every `interval_secs`; writes `HealthStatus` to `state.json` | Container lifetime |

Each health **probe** spawns one additional short-lived thread:

| Thread | Purpose | Lifetime |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Probe thread** | Runs `exec_in_container`; sends result over channel | Duration of probe (≤ `timeout_secs`) |

The probe thread is necessary to enforce `timeout_secs`: the health monitor spawns it
and waits on a channel with `recv_timeout`. If the probe hangs, the channel times out
and the probe thread is abandoned (it will eventually terminate when its child process
dies or is killed by the OS).

### Watcher process — dynamic: port-forward proxy threads

When the container has port mappings (`-p HOST:CONTAINER[/tcp|udp|both]`),
`setup_bridge_network` calls `start_port_proxies` **before the container is forked**.
All proxy tasks/threads therefore live in the **watcher process**, not the container.
The nftables DNAT rules handle non-localhost traffic; the userspace proxy handles
traffic from `localhost` (which nftables PREROUTING cannot intercept).

#### TCP proxy — tokio multi-threaded runtime

TCP port forwarding uses a single tokio multi-threaded runtime
(`new_multi_thread`, `min(available_parallelism, 4)` worker threads named
`remora-tcp-proxy`). All accept loops and relay tasks are async tasks on this
pool. Connection count does **not** affect OS thread count.

**Per watcher (all TCP-mapped ports share one runtime) — W worker threads:**

| Threads | Purpose | Lifetime |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **W tokio worker threads** | Drive all async TCP accept loops and relay tasks | Until `Runtime::shutdown_background()` at container teardown |

**Per TCP-mapped port — 1 persistent async task:**

| Task | Purpose | Lifetime |
|------|----------|----------|
| **`tcp_accept_loop`** | Async accept on `0.0.0.0:{host_port}`; spawns a `tcp_relay` task per connection | Until runtime is dropped |

**Per active TCP connection — 1 transient async task:**

| Task | Purpose | Lifetime |
|------|----------|----------|
| **`tcp_relay`** | `tokio::io::copy_bidirectional` between client and container | Until either side closes |

**Per UDP-mapped port — 1 persistent thread:**

| Thread | Purpose | Lifetime |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **UDP proxy** (`start_udp_proxy`) | Receives datagrams from clients; maintains per-client session table; forwards to container | Until stop flag set at container teardown |

**Per active UDP client session — 1 transient thread (spawned on first datagram from that client):**

| Thread | Purpose | Lifetime |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **UDP reply forwarder** | Receives datagrams from container on the session's outbound socket; forwards to originating client | Until stop flag set; sessions idle >30 s are evicted |

UDP session threads are spawned inside the UDP proxy loop the first time a datagram
arrives from a new client address. They share the stop flag with the port's proxy thread
and exit when it is set. The session table is evicted every receive loop iteration for
entries idle longer than 30 seconds.

### Thread count formula

Let W = `min(available_parallelism, 4)` (tokio TCP worker threads; 0 if no TCP ports).

```
total = 3 (static)
      + 1  (health monitor, if HEALTHCHECK)
      + W  (TCP proxy worker threads, if any TCP ports; shared across all TCP ports)
      + N_udp_ports          (UDP proxy threads)
      + active_udp_sessions  (UDP reply threads, transient)
```

Active TCP connections do **not** add threads — they are async tasks on the W workers.

At rest with one TCP port and one UDP port, no HEALTHCHECK, 4-core machine:
**8 threads** (3 static + 4 TCP workers + 1 UDP proxy).

At rest with one TCP port, no UDP, no HEALTHCHECK: **7 threads**.
Under 1000 simultaneous TCP connections on the same port: still **7 threads**.

### Scalability note

The TCP proxy is now O(W) threads regardless of connection count, where W ≤ 4.
Under high TCP connection counts all relay tasks are multiplexed cooperatively across
the W worker threads by the tokio async executor.

The UDP proxy retains the thread-per-session model: O(active UDP sessions) threads.
A future refactor could migrate UDP to an async model as well.

## Library-Level UID/GID Mapping Thread

When a container is configured with `with_user_namespace()` and the `use_id_helpers`
flag is set (i.e., `newuidmap`/`newgidmap` helper binaries are used to write UID/GID
maps), `Command::spawn()` creates one short-lived thread in the **calling process**
(the watcher, for `remora run -d`) before the `fork()`:

| Thread | Purpose | Lifetime |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **UID/GID mapper** | Reads child PID from pipe; runs `newuidmap`/`newgidmap`; signals done | Exits after maps are written (milliseconds) |

This thread is only spawned when user namespaces with external helper binaries are in
use; it exits immediately after writing the maps. It does not persist.

---

## Compose Supervisor Threads

`remora compose up` runs a **supervisor process** (not a watcher) that directly manages
all service containers. Threads in the supervisor are per-service:

| Thread | Purpose | Lifetime |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **stdout relay** | Container stdout pipe → log file | Until pipe closes |
| **stderr relay** | Container stderr pipe → log file | Until pipe closes |
| **Waiter** | `child.wait()` + DNS teardown on exit | Container lifetime |

When services are started concurrently (parallel dependency scheduling), one additional
thread is spawned per service during the startup phase:

| Thread | Purpose | Lifetime |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Service launcher** | Calls `do_container_start_inner`; reports result over channel | Until service is running (or fails) |

These threads all belong to the supervisor process. There is no per-service watcher;
the supervisor is the watcher for all services.

---

## `state.pid` and the Intermediate Process

With PID namespace enabled, `child.pid()` returns the PID of the _intermediate process_
(P), not PID 1 (C). This is the value stored as `state.pid` in `state.json` and used by:

- **`remora ps`** — shows P's PID in the PID column
- **`remora stop`** — sends `SIGTERM` to P; P exits; `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` sends `SIGKILL` to C
- **`remora exec`** — joins P's namespaces (see caveat below)
- **`check_liveness`** — checks `kill(P, 0)`; returns false only after P exits (which happens when C exits)

This is correct: P is alive exactly as long as C is alive. Liveness and stop semantics
work as expected.

---

## `remora exec` and PID Namespace Caveat

`exec_in_container` (and `remora exec`) discover namespaces by comparing
`/proc/{pid}/ns/*` against `/proc/1/ns/*`. When PID namespace is active:

- `/proc/P/ns/mnt` — **container's mount namespace** ✓ (P unshared MOUNT before forking C)
- `/proc/P/ns/net` — **container's network namespace** ✓
- `/proc/P/ns/uts` — **container's UTS namespace** ✓
- `/proc/P/ns/pid` — **host PID namespace** — same inode as `/proc/1/ns/pid` because P
  itself is in the host PID namespace (only P's *children* enter the new namespace)

After the fix (GitHub issue #1), `remora exec` **does** join the container's PID
namespace. `discover_namespaces` checks `/proc/P/ns/pid_for_children` (Linux ≥ 3.8)
as a fallback when the regular `pid` check finds no difference.

Because `setns(CLONE_NEWPID)` only updates `pid_for_children` (it does not move the
calling process), the join requires a **double-fork**: setns → fork → grandchild is
born into the target PID namespace → grandchild execs. This is implemented in
`container.rs` step 1.65 as the "Case B" branch (joining an existing PID namespace),
mirroring how `nsenter --pid` works internally.

---

## Health Monitor Namespace Access

The health monitor calls `exec_in_container(P.pid, probe_cmd)`. As described above, it
joins P's mount, net, and UTS namespaces — which are the container's namespaces. Health
probes run in the container's filesystem and network context, which is exactly what is
needed. The probe not being in the container's PID namespace does not affect correctness.

---

## Signal Propagation

| Signal | Sent to | Effect |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `SIGTERM` (from `remora stop`) | P (intermediate) | P dies → C gets `SIGKILL` via `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` |
| `SIGKILL` | P | Same effect |
| `SIGTERM` | C (PID 1) | C handles or ignores per its signal handlers |

The watcher calls `prctl(PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER, 1)` immediately after `setsid()`.
This makes the watcher the reaper for all orphaned descendants (same role as
`systemd` / `tini`).  If the watcher is killed (e.g. OOM), P is re-parented
**to the watcher** rather than to host PID 1.  When the watcher then exits,
P's `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` fires in one hop and C receives `SIGKILL` — no fragile
two-hop chain.

## Summary of Known Limitations

| Limitation | Impact | Planned fix |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| ~~`remora exec` does not join container PID namespace~~ | ~~`ps` in exec'd shell shows host PIDs~~ | **Fixed** — `pid_for_children` + double-fork (issue #1) |
| Probe timeout does not SIGKILL the probe child | Hung probes consume a thread until OS reaps them | Explicit SIGKILL on timeout |
| Thread-per-fd log relay | O(2) threads per container for I/O | epoll-based relay (future) |
| UDP reply threads are never explicitly reaped | Thread joins on stop flag only; idle sessions may linger until stop | Migrate UDP to async (tokio already used for TCP) |
| ~~Watcher death does not propagate to PID 1~~ | ~~Container orphaned if watcher dies~~ | **Fixed** — `PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER` on watcher (issue #5) |
